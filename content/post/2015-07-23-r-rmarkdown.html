<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This is a statistical analysis of the capacity of homeless shelters in the City of Toronto. This analysis aims to find the different capacities in homeless shelter sectors. This will alow for a better understanding of which sectors have excess capacities and which are struggling to meet the demand.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Homelesness is a serious issue around the country and Toronto is not exempt from that. On any given night there are 9,200 homeless people in Toronto^1. This leaves

I found it very interesting to find out which shelter sector’s are more or less catered for through analysing their excess capacity. I found this very interesting as I have made use of the violin geom in order to add the demension of the capacity density’s</p>
